The Problem
Farming accounts for 85% of total global water use, and alarmingly, 40% of this water is wasted. Farmers often overwater certain parts of their crops, resulting in a significant amount of wasted water that could be better utilized to nourish dried-out areas or support our growing population, especially in an era where climate change is making water resources increasingly scarce. The need for optimized water allocation in agriculture is critical.

Our Solution
Soil Sentry is a mobile app that combines accessible sensor technology with AI to provide real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels and offer AI-driven insights and recommendations to farmers. This solution ensures efficient and sustainable water management practices, reduces water wastage, and improves crop yields.
Key Features
Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring: Integrates with soil moisture sensors to provide accurate, real-time data on soil conditions. Farmers receive alerts and notifications when soil moisture levels fall below or exceed optimal thresholds, ensuring timely intervention.
Drone Integration: Connects with drones to gather aerial data on crop health and soil conditions, predicting issues like soil salinity and advising farmers on preventive measures.
AI Chatbot: Farmers can ask customized questions about their irrigation practices, crop management, and more. The chatbot also incorporates weather forecasts to predict water needs and adjust irrigation schedules.
Crop Recommendations: Suggests crops based on the season and changes in soil conditions throughout the year.
Water Demand Forecasting: Analyzes historical data, weather patterns, and crop requirements to ensure efficient distribution of water resources.
Smart Irrigation Systems: Automates control based on real-time soil moisture data and AI recommendations, integrating with existing systems to save both time and water.
Leak Detection: Detects potential leaks in irrigation systems, reducing water loss by sending alerts and maintenance recommendations.
Water Tank Monitoring: Tracks the usage of water tanks and rain tanks separately, providing real-time data on water levels, detecting leaks, and sending alerts.
